## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Austin, and I've been involved with human-subject research for over 10 years. I worked with various datasets (e.g., brain responses) and acquired skills important for data analytics (e.g., data quality), data science (e.g., machine learning), and project management. I am looking for job positions where I can continue my growth as a critical thinker and data enthusiast!
